## Description
The core algorithm for this application is the URL substring matching algorithm. It helps users determine which keywords (of a list of keywords of their choosing) exist inside of each URL of one or more URLs. A user is able to utilize this algorithm by interacting with the Command Line Interface (CLI). This allows users to specify the keywords (i.e. substrings) and target URLs through the command line or specify them inside of files --- keywords.txt for keywords and urls.txt for URLs.

Once the algorithm has the keywords and URLs it needs to run, it displays each URL with a list of matching keywords in alphabetical order. Since the challenge did not provide much detail on what the output should be, I decided to output it in a manner that was more useful for humans.

The current algorithm can process a 2,200 character URL with 367,000 keywords in about 3 - 4 ms. It takes less time the shorter the URL gets (as low as .04ms for a relatively normal sized URL). If the URL gets very large (e.g. 11,000+ characters), however, it slows down and takes approximately 16 ms to process 367,000 keywords. The number of substrings/keywords can affect it, of course, but its impact is relatively minor compared to a URL's length, since the algorithm creates a Trie from the provided substrings/keywords before accepting URLs. We can optimize the algorithm further, but I felt this was unnecessary for the time-being. I requested clarification, but received little. As a result, I decided to make a decision based on my own research.

To elaborate further, it seems that most browsers can safely handle URLs up to an approximate size of 2000 +/- 100. Furthermore, it appears that the only kinds of URLs that would go past 2,000 characters are data URLs, but they are usually composed of random combinations of letters (i.e. incomprehensible gibberish). As such, encountering a URL of 2,200 characters seems like the more likely scenario one would encounter. Therefore, I  weighed the pros and cons, and feel relatively comfortable leaving the current version of the algorithm in its less efficient form --- a 3 to 4 ms is not a bad runtime for a URL with 2,200 characters and a keyword list of approximately 367,000 words.

One of the scenarios where a more optimal algorithm will become necessary is when comparing partial genetic (e.g. DNA, RNA) sequences against a much larger genetic sequence, but that is not what this challenge was about.
## How to use

### DO THIS FIRST
1. Before anything, you need to install Python 3.9 or higher (preferably in a virtual environment). 
2. Use the command line (terminal on a Mac OS) to navigate to the project's directory (i.e. ROCKERBOX CHALLENGE).
3. Use the command line to navigate to the 'substring_matcher' directory.
4. Once inside the 'ROCKERBOX_CHALLENGE/substring_matcher' directory, you have a few options:
   <br>a. Run tests
   <br>b. Get average runtimes for 100 runs of the algorithm using varying URL sizes with approximately 369,000 keywords.
   <br>c. Interact with the URL substring matching script using the CLI.

<br>

### Assuming you are inside of the 'ROCKERBOX_CHALLENGE/substring_matcher' directory:

#### Running Tests:
If you want to run tests, type `python3 tests.py` into the command line and press the 'Enter' or Return key.

<br>

#### Getting Average Runtimes:
If you want to get the average run times in milliseconds (ms), type `python3 tests.py` into the command line and press the 'Enter' or Return key.

##### This will run the algorithm 1000 times while using 369,985 keywords to match against URLs for four different lengths:

1. Short URL: 22 characters long.
2. Medium URL: 283 characters long.
3. Long URL: 2,511 characters long.
4. Super Long URL: 11,778 characters long.

##### My own tests on a Mid-2012 Macbook Pro with 8 GB RAM and a 2.3 Ghz i7 Quad Core processor while under heavy load revealed average runtimes in the range of the following (out of multiple sets of 1000 runs):

1. Short URL: 0.045 ms - 0.052 ms
2. Medium URL: 0.55 ms - 0.65 ms
3. Long URL: 3.63 ms - 4.25 ms
4. Super Long URL: 14.71 ms - 16.96 ms


##### To change the number of times the algorithm runs, open the constants.py file inside of ROCKERBOX_CHALLENGE/substring_matcher and change the NUMBER_OF_DESIRED_RUNS value to whatever you like (e.g. 100000).
<br>

#### Running the Command Line Interface (CLI):
If you want to interact with the CLI, there are a few things you should set up before using it.

*NOTE: If you do not plan on using files for your keywords and URLs (i.e. you want to enter the keywords and URLs via the command line), you can skip steps (1) and (2).*
<br>
<br>

1. If you plan to use a file for your keywords, you need to add the keywords to the keywords.txt file.
   - From the project's root directory, navigate to the 'data' directory.
   - Open the 'keywords.txt' file and add your keywords there. Each keywords should be on a new line.
   - OR, if you want to use a text file you already have:
     1. Delete or rename the existing 'keywords.txt' inside of the 'ROCKERBOX_CHALLENGE/substring_matcher/data' directory
     2. Now, go to your file that contains the keywords you want to use.
     3. Convert your file to a text file (has a .txt extension), if it is not one already.
     4. Rename it to 'keywords.txt'.
     5. Move it to the 'ROCKERBOX_CHALLENGE/substring_matcher/data' directory.
     6. Make sure that all of the keywords (substrings) are on separate lines without single or double quotes around them.
   
2. If you plan to use a file for your URLs, you need to add the URLs to the keywords.txt file.
   - From the project's root directory, navigate to the 'data' directory.
   - Open the 'urls.txt' file and add your URLs there. Each URL should be on a new line.
   - OR, if you want to use a text file you already have:
     1. Delete or rename the existing 'urls.txt' inside of the 'ROCKERBOX_CHALLENGE/substring_matcher/data' directory
     2. Now, go to your file that contains the URLs you want to use.
     3. Convert your file to a text file (has a .txt extension), if it is not one already.
     4. Rename it to 'urls.txt.'
     5. Move it to the 'ROCKERBOX_CHALLENGE/substring_matcher/data' directory.
     6. Make sure that all of the URLs are on separate lines without single or double quotes around them.
   
3. Using the command line, make sure you are in the project's root directory.
4. Type `python3 substring_matcher_cli.py` into the command line and press the 'Enter' or 'Return' key.
5. This will display a welcome message.
6. Follow the instructions on the screen from here on out.

## Future Plans
1. Clean the code inside of the substring_matcher_cli.py file.
   - Since the individuals who requested this challenge did not seem to care about the CLI, I left the code that manages the CLI with some repetition.

2. Optimize the code further to use even less time than it does now.
   - The search/lookup for any single known keyword is O(n), but this is not the case for a URL with an unkown amount of unknown mixed and overlapping keywords.
   - Since the time complexity in a worst case scenario for iterating through the URL to match all possible keywords is O( n^2). I would like to get this down to O(n) or O(n * log(n)), if possible.
